## Solution

Good day, let’s tease our brain.

So the problem asks us to rearrange all the values in the odd level of the tree in a reversing fashion. We can solve it both dfs way and bfs way. For this solution, i’ll provide the dfs way, since I’m more familiar to that, lol.

### Step 1: Identifying the solution type

In order to solve this coding problem in dfs, one must first traverse all the nodes to perfrom the operations. This is because of the characteristic of the depth-first search. Hmm, this means that we need something to help us memorize all the nodes in some certain level.

This is where we use hashmap, by using a hashmap we are able to store all the node with a certain level value into it. After we traversed the entire tree, we can jump back to the operation.

### Step 2: perform operation

Since for each entry of the hashmap we store the vector of the treenode pointers, that means whenever we made modifications to the nodes such as alter the value can and will eventually affect the original tree value. That means for us we only have to deal with each entry of the hashmap now.

Notice that the order of the treenode stored in the vector is exaclty the way it is presented from left to right. Again, this is because of the dfs characteristic. For now, what we are gonna do is simply reverse the values in the vector full of tree node pointers. Volia.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    unordered_map<int, vector<TreeNode *>> mp;
    void count(TreeNode *root, int level) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return;
        }
        if (level % 2 == 1) {
            mp[level].push_back(root);
        }
        count(root->left, level + 1);
        count(root->right, level + 1);
    }
    TreeNode *reverseOddLevels(TreeNode *root) {
        count(root, 0);
        for (auto [a, b] : mp) {
            int n = b.size();
            for (int i = 0, j = n - 1; i < n / 2; i++, j--) {
                int t = b[i]->val;
                b[i]->val = b[j]->val;
                b[j]->val = t;
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
};
```
