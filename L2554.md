# 2554. Maximum Number of Integers to Choose From a Range I

## Solution

This problem asks us to obtain the maximum set of numbers whose total sum is less than or equal to the given maxSum.

So, this problem reducces to that we can add thosebanned number into a hashtable, and iterate through 1 to n. The reason for that is we want our set to be as big as possible.

## Code

```c
#define maxN 10005

class Solution {
   public:
    int maxCount(vector<int>& banned, int n, int maxSum) {
        int res = 0;
        vector<int> mp(maxN, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < banned.size(); i++) {
            mp[banned[i]] = 1;
        }
        int currsum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (mp[i] == 0 && currsum + i <= maxSum) {
                currsum += i;
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
