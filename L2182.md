## Solution

Good day, letâ€™s tease our brain.

So the problem asks us to take the string from a intial defined domain, and produce the maximum lexiographical order string possible. The challenge here is that each character has a maximum repeatLength, meaning that each the consecuteve length of a specific char cannot exceed some value repeatedLength.

We are going to use a heap here, to constantly keep track of the maximum character that we can use for constructing the final string.

### Step 1 : Define a struct

First we define a struct to store all the char, giving each of them some properties: ch itself (for convenience), power (the lexiographical order), and lastly the cnt, which is the number of that particular char that has been in our domain.

### Step 2: define heap

Now we are going to contruct the heap. In c++, you can use priority queue as an alternate approach, and the implementation would looks simpler.

to define a priorityQueue, you can use the Pair data structure, and just declare the pq in c++, and use the default syntax (max) to solve this.

The reason I use C in this problem is because I want to gice myself some sort of challenge, review myself the the mechanism of how the pq actually works.

### Step 3: Iteration

Unless the heap is empty, we keep extracting the top element. And once we have reached the maximum repeating value, we pop the current element, take one char of the element that is in the second place, and push the original remaining element back.

The reason we push the leftover after we extract from the second place is because of the pushing mechanism in heap. Once we push the remaining, it will automatically get to the top in no time, which returns to the original situation, not quite in our vavor.

## Code

```c
typedef struct {
    char ch;
    int power;
    int cnt;
} Char;

void swap(Char* a, Char* b) {
    Char temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}

void heapify(Char* heap, int size, int index) {
    int largest = index;
    int left = 2 * index + 1;
    int right = 2 * index + 2;
    if (left < size && heap[left].power > heap[largest].power) {
        largest = left;
    }
    if (right < size && heap[right].power > heap[largest].power) {
        largest = right;
    }
    if (index != largest) {
        swap(&heap[index], &heap[largest]);
        heapify(heap, size, largest);
    }
}

void bottomUpHeap(Char* heap, int size) {
    for (int i = size / 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        heapify(heap, size, i);
    }
}

void pushHeap(Char* heap, int* size, Char tar) {
    (*size)++;
    heap[*size - 1] = tar;
    int i = (*size) - 1;
    while (i > 0 && heap[i].power > heap[(i - 1) / 2].power) {
        swap(&heap[i], &heap[(i - 1) / 2]);
        i = (i - 1) / 2;
    }
}

void popHeap(Char* heap, int* size) {
    heap[0] = heap[(*size) - 1];
    (*size)--;
    heapify(heap, *size, 0);
}

char* repeatLimitedString(char* s, int repeatLimit) {
    Char* heap = (Char*)malloc(100 * sizeof(Char));
    int cnt[26] = {0};
    int n = strlen(s);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cnt[s[i] - 'a']++;
    }
    int size = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (cnt[i] == 0) {
            continue;
        }
        heap[size].ch = (i + 'a');
        heap[size].power = i;
        heap[size].cnt = cnt[i];
        size++;
    }
    bottomUpHeap(heap, size);
    char* res = (char*)malloc((n + 1) * sizeof(char));
    int idx = 0;
    while (size > 0) {
        if (heap[0].cnt > repeatLimit) {
            for (int t = 1; t <= repeatLimit; t++) {
                res[idx++] = heap[0].ch;
            }
            heap[0].cnt -= repeatLimit;
            Char tt = heap[0];
            popHeap(heap, &size);
            if (size == 0) {
                break;
            }
            res[idx++] = heap[0].ch;
            heap[0].cnt--;
            if (heap[0].cnt == 0) {
                popHeap(heap, &size);
            }
            pushHeap(heap, &size, tt);
        } else {
            for (int t = 1; t <= heap[0].cnt; t++) {
                res[idx++] = heap[0].ch;
            }
            heap[0].cnt = 0;
            popHeap(heap, &size);
        }
    }
    res[idx] = '\0';
    return res;
}
```
