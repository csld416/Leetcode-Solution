# 3243. Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries I

## Solution

Initially the graph is a DAG, and to be specific, a linear DAG, meaning that there exist a edge between node i and i+1. The problem further gives us a bunch of query. Iterating throught the queries, for each element(edge), we add it to our current graph. This means the number of edges in the graph is strictly increasing.

Introducing Dijkstra, a algorithm to find the shortest path from a source node to all the rest of the graph. In our case, we want to find the minimum path from the starting node, which is 0, to the last node, which is n-1.

We use adjacent list to represent our graph:

```cpp
vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adjList(n);
```

where n denotes the number of vertices, and for each vertex we have a list storing all the childrens. For each child, we store the identity(vertex) and the weight from the parent to this particular child, we use a pair to store all the nodes being pointed to.

To establish a edge, we simply:

```cpp
adjList[u].push_back({v, 1});
```

note that if this is a undirected graph, we have to establish the edge on both side.

### Step 1: Initialize graph

Inorder to constuct the initial graph, we use the following code snppet:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
	adjList[i].push_back({i + 1, 1});
}
```

### Step 2: iterate through queries

Now we iterate through the query in the given queries, and for each query we first establish a new edge.

### Step 3: Dijkstra main

Starting from the source node, we first push the source node (which is 0) into the pq, and we run through the graph like what we did in bfs. Basically we run until the queue is empty.

for each node traversed, denote as `u`, we first extract the distance of the source node traverse to this node, denote as `dist`. We also declare a int to represent `u`.

Furthermore, we declare a vector distance to fetch the distance from the souce node to each node with $O(1)$ time comlexity.

Now we iterate through all the child of the current node, denote the current iterating child as `v` . Calculate distance (sourece → `u` )+ weight(u, v).

If the value is smaller than distance(source → `v`), we update the distance from source node to `v`. Then, we push this child node into the pq.

Do this repeatedly, until the results comes out. Note that the ith element in the result array is the distance[n-1]. Another thing to note is for each new edge added we need to start the algo from the beginning and reset the distance vector.

### Why priority queue?

The reason for using priority queue is that we want to optimize the traversing operation. since we aim to find the shorest path, we want to choose the one children which has the currently minimum distance from source.

Think of priority queue as a structure storing ‘visitable’. Now, in order to traverse the graph with the minimum distance, we want to operate on the current minimum, right? or else in the worst case we would have to iterate every single node in the graph.

Hope this helps.

## Code

```cpp
typedef pair<int, int> pii;

class Solution {
   public:
    vector<int> shortestDistanceAfterQueries(int n, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        int qs = queries.size();
        vector<int> res(qs);
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adjList(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            adjList[i].push_back({i + 1, 1});
        }
        for (int q = 0; q < qs; q++) {
            adjList[queries[q][0]].emplace_back(queries[q][1], 1);
            vector<int> distance(n, INT_MAX);
            priority_queue<pii, vector<pii>, greater<pii>> pq;
            pq.push({0, 0});
            distance[0] = 0;
            while (pq.size() > 0) {
                int dist = pq.top().first;
                int u = pq.top().second;
                pq.pop();
                for (auto& e : adjList[u]) {
                    int v = e.first;
                    int w = e.second;
                    if (dist + w < distance[v]) {
                        distance[v] = dist + w;
                        pq.push({distance[v], v});
                    }
                }
            }
            res[q] = distance[n - 1];
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
