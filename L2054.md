# 2054. Two Best Non-Overlapping Events

## Solution

Good day, let’s tease our brain.

So the problem asks us to take any two of the events such that:

- They constitute the max value.
- They do not collide.

How do we solve this? Well, in order to refrain from colliding two events, we should do sorting, right? Yes, but on what parameter? Start time or end time?

This is one of the key idea of the entire problem, at first glance it feels like both of the sorting fashion do the job equally well, but there is actually only one correct (much simpler) choice, that is **sorting by END**. The reason for this we shall unveil later.

### Step 1: sorting the events

Starting the program by sorting with respect to the end time of each event:

```cpp
sort(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
     return a[1] < b[1];
});
```

This is lambda function by the way, if you are not familiar.

### Step 2: Create prefixMax array

This part is crucial. In order to find the events that constitute the maximum value, it would be convenient for us if are we are able to know the maximum value from $[ 0, i ]$ for every i from $[0, n-1]$.

We create this by the following code:

```cpp
vector<int> prefixMax(n, 0);
prefixMax[0] = events[0][2];
for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
	prefixMax[i] = max(prefixMax[i - 1], events[i][2]);
}
```

Which I’m sure you are familiar with if you have ever dealt with prefix sum questions before, it is identical.

### Step 3: find the pairs

Now we aim to find two events which satisty the given condition. Iterating through the events, denote every iteration as i. For every i, if we can find some events j, whose ending time is before the time when ith event started, then this is a valid pair. Once we found a valid pair, we can update the maximum value we have found so far. Since the event is sorted with the end time(ascending), that means the $j$ we find later is assured to be less than $i$.

Here’s the interesting part, j should be as close to i as posible. Remember the prefixMax array we constructed earlier? That’s why. As we find the valid candidate for $i$, we hope that i should be as great as possible because the possiblity of this index $j$ to obtain a greater max value from $[0, j]$ is bigger that those before this particular $j$.

### How do we find $j$ ?

The method here is binary search. Although we know that the index $j$ we found is certainly less than the current $i$, we cannot use linear search because the worst case the $i$ could be at the lat index position, which for it needs to traverse all the way from the rightmost index to the closest viable $j$. Using binary search can speed things up.

```cpp
int biSearch(vector<vector<int>>& events, int currIdx) {
    int left = 0, right = events.size() - 1;
    int end = events[currIdx][1];
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (events[mid][1] < events[currIdx][0]) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return right;
}
```

Notice that this format we do not return in the loop, but outside the loop. This regulation is suitable for finding the extreme in the interval of a given array.

### Think about…

1. Same question, but the number of events we can take is not limited
2. Same question, but we limit the number of taken events to be k.

Both of the extended variation of the problem is related to dynamic programming, I highly encourage you to think about that. It is quite intriguing.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    int biSearch(vector<vector<int>>& events, int currIdx) {
        int left = 0, right = events.size() - 1;
        int end = events[currIdx][1];
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (events[mid][1] < events[currIdx][0]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return right;
    }
    int maxTwoEvents(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
        int n = events.size();
        int res = 0;
        sort(events.begin(), events.end(),
             [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) { return a[1] < b[1]; });
        vector<int> prefixMax(n, 0);
        prefixMax[0] = events[0][2];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixMax[i] = max(prefixMax[i - 1], events[i][2]);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int idx = biSearch(events, i);
            if (idx != -1) {
                res = max(res, events[i][2] + prefixMax[idx]);
            } else {
                res = max(res, events[i][2]);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
