# 2290. Minimum Obstacle Removal to Reach Corner

## Solution

Good day. letâ€™s tease our brain.

### Understanding the problem

Since the problem is asking the minimum stone removed from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, we can interpret this problem as a shortest path problem, where we treat each obstacle as a â€˜weight of 1 when traversed toâ€™ while the blanks one does not have weight when traversing.

### Intuition

For this reason, this becomes a classic Dijkstraâ€™s problem, and since the problem has given us a grid, we do not have to manually constuct a graph. Remember that a 2d vector itself suffices the characteristic of a graph, which defines the reaversing relationship between two nodes that allows traversing.

For the Node we store in the pq, we use {cost, i, j}. Putting cost at the very begining of the tuple is because that the greater mechanism in c++ compares the first element in that built-in data sturcture, whether it is tuple or pair.

### Start traversing

First we push the source node into the pq, which is the cell in the top-left corner in our case. For each node popped, we check all the possible adjacent cells, and then add them into the pq.

### Note

Note that the essence in Dijkstra is that:

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

If the next node we are going to traverse from this node has a smaller weight than the currnet distance from other node to the destined node, we traverse.

</aside>

This mean if the distance[next] already posseses a distance smaller than that of we traverse from our current position, we halt, and just ignore(not pushing it into the pq).

## Code

```cpp
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef tuple<int, int, int> piii;

class Solution {
   public:
    int di[4] = {0, -1, 0, 1};
    int dj[4] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
    int minimumObstacles(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        int m = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(n, vector<bool>(m, false));
        priority_queue<piii, vector<piii>, greater<piii>> pq;
        vector<vector<int>> distance(n, vector<int>(m, INT_MAX));
        distance[0][0] = 0;
        pq.push({0, 0, 0});
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto [d, i, j] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            if (visited[i][j]) {
                continue;
            }
            visited[i][j] = true;
            for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
                int ii = i + di[k];
                int jj = j + dj[k];
                if (ii >= n || ii < 0 || jj >= m || jj < 0) {
                    continue;
                }
                int nd = d + grid[ii][jj];
                if (nd < distance[ii][jj]) {
                    distance[ii][jj] = nd;
                    pq.push({nd, ii, jj});
                }
            }
        }
        return distance[n - 1][m - 1];
    }
};
