# 2924. Find Champion II

## Solution

So basically the problem is just asking:

If we were to topologically sort this DAG, output the ansector, and there should only be one.

Therefore, we declare a vector to store the number of vertices that points to a specific vertex, denote as `indegree`.

if the number of vertex whose indegree is 0 are more than 1, we return -1. Else, we find the vertex who mathces our demand.

The implementation is as follows, the time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    int findChampion(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<int> indegree(n, 0);
        int mx = n;
        for (auto& e : edges) {
            if (indegree[e[1]] == 0) {
                mx--;
            }
            indegree[e[1]]++;
        }
        if (mx > 1) {
            return -1;
        } else {
            for (int i = 0; i < indegree.size(); i++) {
                if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                    return i;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
