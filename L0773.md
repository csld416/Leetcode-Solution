## Solution

So the problem is asking if we can swap the adjacent cells with one of them being zero, to achieve:

| 1   | 2   | 3   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4   | 5   | 0   |

Moreover, if it is achievable, what is the minimal swapping operation needed?

### Observation 1: the position of the ‘0’ is the key

Notice that we can move the cells with one of them being 0, that means the only thing we care about is 0, and that’s where we want to focus on.

### Observation 2: Minimum operation needed → BFS

One important thing to note is that in order to obtain the minimum opeartions, we aim to use BFS. The reason for this is because BFS allows us to find the minimum height(operations) in the possibility tree diagram.

Armed with this knowledge, we would use queue to store the possible outcome of the current node, and operate through them one by one. For each new outcome, we also insert them into the queue, but they stay at the back of the line.

### Observaiton 3: State → string

Just like what we do in the usual dfs problem, we want to avoid to traverse to the same state twice. In order to acheive this, we store the traversed state in a set, and for each new state encountered, check if it existed in the state.

By putting the 2d grid into the set isn’t a really clever idea. Instead, we will convert each 2d grid into a string, that way we can store them much easily.

### Implementation

So for each position in the grid have different traversing direction. Since we have transform the grid into a string, that means for each index in the string can have different position possibilities. Thus, we first declare all the possible directions for each encountered index.

```cpp
unordered_map<int, vector<int>> direction = {
	{0, {1, 3}}, {1, {0, 2, 4}}, {2, {1, 5}},
    {3, {0, 4}}, {4, {1, 3, 5}}, {5, {2, 4}}
};
```

now we start to deal with the possibilities. We define a tuple:

```cpp
tuple<int, string, int>
```

as a state we put in the queue, it notes the `curr0Pos` , `currString` , `currMove` .

define a set of string to be visited.

The BFS implementation is as below, good day.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    string arrToStr(vector<vector<int>> v) {
        string ans = "";
        for (auto &row : v) {
            for (auto &num : row) {
                ans += to_string(num);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    int slidingPuzzle(vector<vector<int>> &board) {
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> direction = {{0, {1, 3}}, {1, {0, 2, 4}}, {2, {1, 5}},
                                                     {3, {0, 4}}, {4, {1, 3, 5}}, {5, {2, 4}}};

        string target = "123450";
        string b = arrToStr(board);
        deque<tuple<int, string, int>> q;
        q.emplace_back((int)b.find('0'), b, 0);
        unordered_set<string> visited;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [zero_pos, currBoard, moves] = q.front();
            q.pop_front();
            if (currBoard == target) {
                return moves;
            }
            for (int nextpos : direction[zero_pos]) {
                string next = currBoard;
                swap(next[zero_pos], next[nextpos]);
                if (!visited.count(next)) {
                    q.emplace_back(nextpos, next, moves + 1);
                    visited.insert(next);
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
