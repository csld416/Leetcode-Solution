# 2097. Valid Arrangement of Pairs

## Solution

Good day, let’s tease out brain (2024/11/30)

So the problem asks us to find a ‘Eulerian Path’ for the given graph, and it is assured there existed one.

### Note for Eulerian Path & Eulerian Circuit

For a path given, asked to find the eulerian path to this node, The one thing we should check is the in and out for each node in the graph. You see, The method of finding Eulerian path would collapse if some condition did not suffice.

Let me call the node who has more outgoing edge than incoming edges as `out`. While calling the node who has more incoming edges rather than outgoing edges as `in`.

For a valid Eulerian Circuit, both number of the out node and the in node should not exceed more than 1.

Notice that the `out` node should be the starting node if we were to traverse the graph and obtain a eulerian path. This is because if a node has more incoming edges then outcoming edges and we start from that node, we are guarenteed to lack of at least one edge to traverse away from this node. Thus, choosing the one node who has more outgoing node than incoming node is paramount.

What about the ending node? I encourage you think of it yourself, applying the same logic we mentioned in the previous paragraph.

Well, the oposite is true for this case! Like what we mentioned in the previous paragraph, the node where out > in is the starting node, that means for the node that is in > out.

Armed with this knowledge, we can now traverse our graph starting from `start`.

### **Hierholzer's algorithm**

Introducing **Hierholzer's algorithm**, which finds the eulerian path of the graph effectively.

Here comes the tricky part. Since we are finding the Eulerian path, that means we have to traverse every edge. This is what makes it different from a normal bfs or dfs method, since we need to backtrack to not the unvisited node but the unvisited edge in the graph.

In a normal dfs problem, the dfs methodology is rather simple. We recursively visit the next node, and if the current position reached some consition, we return the function.

How do we backtrack? What condition should be set to trigger the return action? Think about it, the reason we halt the dfs is because there is nothing left to search down there. Similarly, in our case, when we reach a node who has no outgoing and unvisited-edge, we should return the current dfs, and backtrack to the previous node.

This is quite intuitive, what we are going to do is do what out best in any other dfs problem.

Below I present two different solutions, one is using recursive functionm while the other one uses an alternative method: stack.

## Code 1: Recursively depth-first-search

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    vector<vector<int>> validArrangement(vector<vector<int>>& pairs) {
        map<int, deque<int>> adjList;
        map<int, int> in, out;
        for (auto& pair : pairs) {
            adjList[pair[0]].push_back(pair[1]);
            in[pair[1]]++;
            out[pair[0]]++;
        }
        int start = pairs[0][0];
        for (auto& [node, _] : adjList) {
            if (out[node] > in[node]) {
                start = node;
                break;
            }
        }
        vector<int> path;
        function<void(int)> dfs = [&](int node) {
            while (!adjList[node].empty()) {
                int nextNode = adjList[node].front();
                adjList[node].pop_front();
                dfs(nextNode);
            }
            path.push_back(node);
        };
        dfs(start);
        reverse(path.begin(), path.end());
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < path.size() - 1; ++i) {
            result.push_back({path[i], path[i + 1]});
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Code 2: Stack

Think about it, we want to track our history of traversing in order to backtrack. What is the best data structure to apply when it comes to this kind of situation? That’s it, stack.

Similar to the method we did in the dfs method, we keep searching until we find a dead end, and we backtrack to the previous node, and choose the alterantive paths until the children of this node have all reached dead end… and so n and so forth, until all the node in the graph becomes a dead end and finally we obtained the eulerian path.

Note that the first node inserted is the first dead end, that means it is the deepest dead end, making this this node a perfect candidate to become the final node of this graph. Likewise, the last node inserted should be our staring node, therefore we are to reverse the path vector in order to obtain the valid eulerian path.

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    vector<vector<int>> validArrangement(vector<vector<int>>& pairs) {
        int n = pairs.size();
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        map<int, deque<int>> adjList;
        map<int, int> in;
        map<int, int> out;
        for (auto p : pairs) {
            adjList[p[0]].push_back(p[1]);
            in[p[1]]++;
            out[p[0]]++;
        }
        int start = pairs[0][0];
        for (auto [node, _] : adjList) {
            if (out[node] > in[node]) {
                start = node;
                break;
            }
        }
        stack<int> stack;
        vector<int> path;
        stack.push(start);

        while (!stack.empty()) {
            int node = stack.top();
            if (!adjList[node].empty()) {
                int next_node = adjList[node].front();
                adjList[node].pop_front();  // Remove edge
                stack.push(next_node);
            } else {
                path.push_back(node);
                stack.pop();
            }
        }
        reverse(path.begin(), path.end());
        vector<vector<int>> result;

        for (size_t i = 0; i < path.size() - 1; ++i) {
            result.push_back({path[i], path[i + 1]});
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
