# 2779. Maximum Beauty of an Array After Applying Operation

## Solution

Good day, let’s tease our brain.

Given a data stream (array), we are allowed to modify each element integer into another integer in a viable interval, and we are asked to find what is the biggest common number of value we can obtain by such operation.

At first glance, it feels futile to decide which number should we choose as a target. However, that isn’t the case here. The value is not important in the matter of fact here in this problem.

You see, we can treat each element in the array as a interval, then the problem has altered to ‘what is the maximum number of overlapping inverval?’ Now there is actually a algorithm/approach regarding this topic, i encourage you to go out there and learn about this(if you aren’t familiar with that already.)

The implementation is as follows.

## Code

```cpp
using pic = pair<int, char>;

class Solution {
   public:
    int maximumBeauty(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        vector<pic> v;
        for (int x : nums) {
            int up = x + k;
            int down = x - k;
            v.emplace_back(down, 'x');
            v.emplace_back(up, 'y');
        }
        sort(v.begin(), v.end());
        int res = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        for (auto e : v) {
            if (e.second == 'x') {
                cnt++;
            } else {
                cnt--;
            }
            res = max(res, cnt);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
