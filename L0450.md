## Solution

Good day, let’s tease our brain.

This is a very classic problem. For those who studied data structure should be familiar of this problem. After understanding the mechanism of removing a node, this problem reduces to a piece of cake.

### Step 1: recursively traversal

Observing the above description, notice that the main procedure initiates after we reduce to the base case, which is find a node to replace the one that we want to remove. Armed with this knowledge, that means not until we met the one node that is commensurate should we move, and therefore we traverse the tree by such:

```cpp
if (!root) {
    return root;
}
if (key < root->val) {
    root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
} else if (key > root->val) {
    root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
} else {
	//TODO
}
```

That way, when we finish our removing operation somewhere, we can contruct the desired tree bottom-up.

### Step 2: Base case considering

For a base case which is a ‘two’ layer of tree, there are three conditions to consider:

1. Case one: left empty, right exist: this one is simple, we simply replace the root node with the right descendant.
2. Case two: left exist, right empty: same as above, but this time we replace the root node with the left descendant.
3. Case three: both children branch exist:

   Now this is something that we want to address. Formally, there are two ways to solve this.

   1. Replace the root node with its in-order successor. (minimum node in the right subtree)
   2. Replace the root node with its in-order predecessor. (Maximum node in the left subtree)

   Usually we go with the first option, I don’t know why exactly but this is what my textbook told me, lol.

```cpp
} else {
		TreeNode* child = root->right;
    TreeNode* parent = root;
	    while (child->left) {
	        parent = child;
	        child = child->left;
	    }
	    root->val = child->val;
	    if (parent->left == child) {
	        parent->left = child->right;
	    } else {
	        parent->right = child->right;
	    }
	    delete child;
}
```

Notice that there is a weird snippet:

```cpp
if (parent->left == child) {
    parent->left = child->right;
} else {
    parent->right = child->right;
}
```

You may be wondering: Wait, if we are tracing the smallest node in the right subtree of the root node, and that for each child update the parent also update itself, that means the child should be guarenteed to be the left of the parent, right? so why bother?

Well good question! The observation is solid, but it fails. You see, there is one big expection, which is ‘the first child being the leaf node of the left subtree’

If the initial child is the final result, that means the child would be on the right of the parent instead of left. So by discussing the situation seperately we can address this issue efficiently.

## Code

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
   public:
    TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
        if (!root) {
            return root;
        }
        if (key < root->val) {
            root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
        } else if (key > root->val) {
            root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
        } else {
            if (!root->left) {
                TreeNode* temp = root->right;
                delete root;
                return temp;
            } else if (!root->right) {
                TreeNode* temp = root->left;
                delete root;
                return temp;
            } else {
                TreeNode* child = root->right;
                TreeNode* parent = root;
                while (child->left) {
                    parent = child;
                    child = child->left;
                }
                root->val = child->val;
                if (parent->left == child) {
                    parent->left = child->right;
                } else {
                    parent->right = child->right;
                }
                delete child;
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
};
```
