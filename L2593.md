# 2593. Find Score of an Array After Marking All Elements

## Solution

Good day, let’s tease our brain.

So the problem asks us to find the minimum cost until all the element in the initiall array us either marked. Maybe you can guess where this is going now. That’s right, we are using a priority queue.

### Step 1: define the struct

The first condition requires that we have to choose the element with the minimum value, and the tie breaker for this is the index. “If the values are the same, choose the one with smaller index.”

Now, in order to do that we have to define a new element, let’s name it ‘E’, definition as follows:

```cpp
struct E {
	int val;
	int index;
};
```

### Step 2: define the priority queue

Now that we have the element ready, we can declare our prioirty queue for us to use:

```perl
priority_queue<E, vector<E>, cmp> pq;
```

This syntax is for us to define a prioiry queue but with different comparison logic other than max heap. The comparing logic we are using here is called cmp, the definition is as follows:

```cpp
struct cmp {
    bool operator()(const E& x, const E& y) const {
        if (x.val != y.val) {
            return x.val > y.val;
        }
        return x.index > y.index;
    }
};
```

Different than the declaration in C, we don’t directly use a bool or int, but rather a `operator` embedded in another struct.

Notice that we return $x > y$ rather than $x<y$ even though we aim to construct a min-heap. The reason for this is due to the special comparison logic in the c++ prioirty queue. In c++, the compiler emphasizes the importance of the second element but not the first one.

In other words, if we were to consturct a min-heap, the returning condition should be $y<x$, where y is the second parameter of the comparison logic.

### Step 3: Simulation

Now that we have everything we need, we can start our simulation. Start from choosing a smallest element in the pq, if the element is marked, then we move to the next iteration. Otherwise, we mark the adjacent element, and add the current node into the result variable.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    struct E {
        int val;
        int index;
    };
    struct cmp {
        bool operator()(const E& x, const E& y) const {
            if (x.val != y.val) {
                return x.val > y.val;
            }
            return x.index > y.index;
        }
    };
    long long findScore(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long res = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> marked(n, 0);
        priority_queue<E, vector<E>, cmp> pq;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            pq.push({nums[i], i});
        }
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            E e = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            if (marked[e.index]) {
                continue;
            }
            marked[e.index] = 1;
            if (e.index - 1 >= 0) {
                marked[e.index - 1] = 1;
            }
            if (e.index + 1 < n) {
                marked[e.index + 1] = 1;
            }
            res += 1LL * e.val;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
